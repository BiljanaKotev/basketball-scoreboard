This project is from the Scrimba learn Javascript course. This is the first solo project from that course. We were given Figma design files to view and code from scratch on our own. I learned how to import a custom font using the @face-font CSS at rule. I also got to practice using functions, onclick event listeners, and manipulating the DOM by rendering text inside the html elements.
